# [authenticator-pro-offline](https://christovic.github.io/andotp-offline)

### A utility to read and use decrypted backups from [Authenticator Pro](https://github.com/jamie-mh/AuthenticatorPro) to create OTP codes without the app itself.

Adapted from Jakob's [WebDecrypt](https://github.com/andOTP/WebDecrypt) for the cryptography side of things, and Dan's [totp-generator](https://github.com/jaden/totp-generator) for the OTP stuff.
